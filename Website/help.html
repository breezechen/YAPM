    <h2><a name="RemoteManagement"></a>Remote management</h2>
    <h3>Change connection type</h3>
    <p>The first thing to do if you want to change the system you want to monitor is to change the connection type. There are three connection types :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>Local : this is the default connection type. It is used to monitor the local system.</LI>
        <LI>Remote via WMI : this is a connection type to monitor a remote system via WMI (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394582(VS.85).aspx">Windows Management Instrumentation</a>)</LI>
        <LI>Remote via YAPM server : this is a connection type to monitor a remote system via a client-server architecture</LI>
    </ul>
    <p>To change the connection type, you have to open the 'Connection window' (Menu -&gt; Change connection type). Then, disconnect from current machine, choose the new connection, configure it&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;'Connect'.</p>
    <h3>Which connection should I&nbsp;choose ?</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">If you want to monitor the local machine, use 'local connection'.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">If you want to monitor a remote machine, there are different points you should consider :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>If you only want the list of processes/services with basic informations, Start/Stop features, you should use WMI</LI>
        <LI>If you do not have an account on the remote machine, you have to&nbsp;use WMI</LI>
        <LI>If you want to use Windows Performance Counters, you have to&nbsp;use WMI</LI>
        <LI>If you want to monitor the remote system and manage handles, memory or use some other advanced features, you have to&nbsp;use the server</LI>
        <LI>If you want to save report about&nbsp;the remote system, you have to&nbsp;use the server</LI>
        <LI>If you want to search something with Search feature, you have to&nbsp;use the server</LI>
        <LI style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">In other cases, keep in mind that :</LI>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <LI style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">WMI might be fastest than the server</LI>
        <LI>The server should always work (even if WMI is not installed for example), this is not the case of&nbsp;WMI</LI>
        <LI>WMI might be easiest to use</LI>
    </ol>
    <h3>WMI method</h3>
    <p>WMI method is the easiest way to monitor a remote system. You only need an account with a password on the remote machine. WMI must also be available in the remote machine (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=RPC+Server+Unavailable">RPC server must be started</a>). Here is the way you should follow to&nbsp;connect YYAPM to the remote machine :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>start the remote machine and launch YAPM on the local machine</LI>
        <LI>disconnect YAPM from the local machine</LI>
        <LI>choose 'WMI connection'</LI>
        <LI>enter the name of the remote machine</LI>
        <LI>enter your username and your password (empty password are NOT allowed)</LI>
        <LI>connect to remote machine ('Connect' button)</LI>
    </ul>
    <p>WMI is a nice way to monitor remote computers, but it is quite limited. Only some informations/features are available :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>List of processes (but some informations are not visible)</LI>
        <LI>List of services (but some informations are not visible)</LI>
        <LI>List of modules (but some informations are not visible)</LI>
        <LI>List of threads (but some informations are not visible)</LI>
        <LI>New process / Kill process / Change process priority</LI>
        <LI>All actions on services</LI>
    </ul>
    <h3>Client-server method</h3>
    <p>Client-server method is more complex than WMI and it requires to run something (the server) on the remote machine. But it allows to monitor&nbsp;the processes/services/modules/... and all related objects just as if you were monitoring a local machine : all features/informations are available (except performance counters).</p>
    <p>Here is the way you should follow to&nbsp;connect YAPM&nbsp;to the remote machine :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>start the remote machine and launch YAPM on the local machine</LI>
        <LI>start YAPM as a server on the remote machine (use launch server.bat, it launches YAPM with -server option)</LI>
        <LI>disconnect YAPM from the local machine</LI>
        <LI>choose 'Client-server connection'</LI>
        <LI>enter the IP&nbsp;of the remote machine</LI>
        <LI>connect to remote machine ('Connect' button)</LI>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="EmergencyHotkeys"></a>Emergency hotkeys</h2>
    <p>This is a feature which allows to assign a shortcut to a specified action. Once you have open the 'Emergency hotkeys' window (Menu -&gt; Emergency hotkeys), right-click on the listview and choose 'Add'. Then select the shortcut you want to use and the action you want to associate with. 'Remove' command delete the action definitevely (use Enable/Disable to temporarily remove a previous added shortcut). The shortcut are saved in 'hotkeys.xml' file in YAPM directory.</p>
    <p>Note that the actions available depends from the version of YAPM you are using. For now, you can not add your own custom actions.</p>
    <p>The shortcut will work only when YAPM is running.</p>
    <h2><a name="StateBasedActions"></a>State Based Actions</h2>
    <p>Not available for now !</p>

Select the desired window and release the left button of your mouse, it will select the process associated to the window.</p>
    <h2><a name="ShowHiddenProcesses"></a>Show hidden processes</h2>
    <p>This feature allows to view hidden processes, such as rootkits. As it uses user mode functions (no kernel functions), it shows <i>only basic</i> rootkits. There are two methods of detection available, you can change the method&nbsp;by clicking on the small &quot;shield&quot;&nbsp;icon on the bottom of the window.</p>
    <h2><a name="DetailedViewForProcess"></a>Detailed view for process</h2>
    <p>When you double-click on a process&nbsp;(list of the processes&nbsp;on the main form), it opens a form which shows all available informations about the process. There are 16&nbsp;tabs :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>General : general informations about the process ('Get online infos' displays online informations about the process, depending on its name)</LI>

        <LI>History : display the history of one or more numerical counter(s). Select the desired counters on the left to display the associated graphs on the right. The history of all processes is collected&nbsp;in memory in real time and there is no need to open the detail view of the&nbsp;processes&nbsp;to collect informations, but the size of informations collected&nbsp;is limited. By default, only 100KB of history data are stored by process. You can configure it (or set it as unlimited) in the 'Preferences' window.</LI>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="DetailedViewForService"></a>Detailed view for service</h2>
    <p>When you double-click on a service (list of the services on the main form), it opens a form which shows all available informations about the service. There are 4 tabs :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>General - 1 : display general informations ('Get online infos' displays online informations about the service, depending on its name)</LI>
        <LI>General - 2 : some other informations</LI>
        <LI>Dependencies : display dependencies of the service</LI>
        <LI>Informations : display informations as text (RTF)</LI>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="LogFeature"></a>Log feature</h2>
    <p>This feature allows to monitor all changes made by/on a process (Process detail view -&gt; Log tab). Check 'Activate log' to enable the feature to collect the changes.</p>
    <p>Click on 'Options' and choose the desired options :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>Capture : the changes to monitor. For example, if you check 'Handles', it will monitor the handles opened/closed by the process. Check 'Created' and/or 'Deleted' to monitor new objects and/or deleted objects (in our example : opened handles and/or closes handles).</LI>
        <LI>Show : the items to show on the list. If you uncheck all boxes, nothing will be displayed, and if you check all boxes, all collected changes will be displayed. This option should be used for two reasons : to see only specific changes (example : you monitor everything and just want to see new threads), and to economize CPU usage (when all options are activated, display all changes may require a lot of CPU time)</LI>
        <LI>Interval : the interval between two 'snapshots of informations'. If you specify a small value, it may will require a lot of CPU time.</LI>
        <LI>Auto scroll : automatically scroll (or not) the view (i.e. ensure that the last item of the listview is available).</LI>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="DependenciesViewer"></a>Dependency viewer</h2>
    <p>This feature allows to view dependencies of an executable/*.dll/*.sys. If the Dependencies viewer is shown with Module-&gt;Show dependencies or Process-&gt;Show dependency, there is no need to select the file, otherwise you will have to use 'Open...' menu.</p>
    <p>Once your file is opened, you will see the import/export tables and all informations available in a standard Dependency viewer.</p>
    <h2><a name="OtherFeatures"></a>Other features and tips</h2>
    <p>Here are some other features and tips you should know :</p>
    <ul>
        <LI>You should read the tooltips when you move your mouse over a control, there are sometimes some useful informations</LI>
        <LI>'Escape' key should close opened forms</LI>
        <LI>Middle-mouse-click on a listview should copy the informations displayed for the selected items into the clipboard</LI>
        <LI>Ctrl+Shift key on an item of a listview will display the pending tasks concerning the item.</LI>
    </ul>
